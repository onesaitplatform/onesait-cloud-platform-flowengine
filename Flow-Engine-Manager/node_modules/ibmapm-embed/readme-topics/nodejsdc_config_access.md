# Configuring the data collector to access Kubernetes resources

If your service account has no access to Kubernetes resources, authorize it with proper access. The following procedure authorizes the service account using RBAC authorization. To use other authorization methods, see [Reference Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/) of Kubernetes.

## Procedure

1. Bind the service to a **Role** that has access to query Kubernetes resources in the RBAC mode.

    a. Prepare a `rolebinding.yaml` file that has the following content:

    Example:
    ```
    kind: RoleBinding
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
    metadata:
      name: get-pods
      namespace: ops-am
    subjects:
    - kind: User
      name: system:serviceaccount:ops-am:default
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    roleRef:
      kind: ClusterRole
      name: admin
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    ```
    **Important**: Change the items in the example to match your own IBM Cloud Private environment.

    b. Run the following command to bind the role:
    ```
    kubectl create -f rolebinding.yaml
    ```
2. Bind the service to a **ClusterRole** that has access to query Kubernetes resources in the RBAC mode.
    
    a. Prepare a `clusterrolebinding.yaml` file that has the following content:
    ```
    kind: ClusterRoleBinding
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
    metadata:
      name: list-cluster
    subjects:
    - kind: User
      name: system:serviceaccount:ops-am:default
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    roleRef:
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: ClusterRole
      name: cluster-admin
    ```
    b. Run the following command to bind the role:
    ```
    kubectl create -f clusterrolebinding.yaml
    ```
